About the Course Project
========================================================

This is a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

Instructions:

- Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
- Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
- Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

How to use the application
========================================================

Using the data provided by Galton Families dataset, we fit a linear model to predict a child's height based on the gender and parent's average height.

The application is running on (https://r2po.shinyapps.io/course_project_shiny_appreproducible_pitch/)

ui.R, and Server.R Code in my github repository https://github.com/ayahfouad/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Assignment/tree/master/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Assignment

Galton Families Dataset
========================================================
The data used in the app comes from the GaltonFamilies dataset.
